## Background

IAMs are computational models that produce scenarios of economy, energy
system, land use, and greenhouse-gas emissions developments over time, across
regions, and under different policy assumptions. Large ensembles of such
scenarios by multiple model families underpin major scientific assessments
such as the IPCC reports.

Scenarios are often evaluated in the process of producing new scenarios or
when in the process of collecting and assess existing scenario ensembles.
Specifically, scenarios are often checked against empirical observations,
near-term projections, and sustainability targets to identify scenarios that
are outdated, internally inconsistent, technically infeasible, or ecologically
or socially undesirable. This package provides a versioned, machine-readable 
set of such evaluation criteria so that different research groups can apply 
the same standards.
